### Include Context

❌ **Missing context:** "Is this good enough?"  
✅ **Better:** "I'm an APS 4 applying for APS 5. Does this evidence demonstrate strategic thinking?"

### State Your Goal

❌ **Unclear goal:** "Tell me about APS 6"  
✅ **Better:** "What capabilities do I need to demonstrate to move from APS 5 to APS 6?"

## 🎭 The Four AI Modes

The assistant automatically adapts to your needs:

### 🔍 Auditor Mode
When you share a draft, the AI reviews it against the ILS Profile for your target level.

**Example:**
> "Here's my draft for 'Supports Strategic Direction'. Can you review it for APS 4?"

**Response includes:**
- Score against behavioral indicators
- Specific gaps identified
- Suggestions for improvement

### 🎤 Interviewer Mode
When you're stuck, the AI asks probing questions to help you discover evidence.

**Example:**
> "I can't think of any examples for 'Manages Uncertainty'"

**Response includes:**
- Targeted questions about your experience
- Prompts to recall specific situations
- Framework for structuring your response

### 🔄 Translator Mode
When your language is too informal, the AI upgrades it to professional APS tone.

**Example:**
> "I helped the new guys learn the system"

**Response includes:**
- Professional rewording: "Mentored new staff to facilitate capability development"
- Explanation of why the change matters
- Alternative phrasings

### 🏗️ Architect Mode
When starting fresh, the AI structures your document using the STAR method.

**Example:**
> "I need to write evidence for 'Cultivates Productive Working Relationships'"

**Response includes:**
- STAR template (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Guidance on what to include
- Example language for your level
